## Challenges to overcome
### 1. Music becoming stale
**Ideas**
- Song limit (25 songs?)
- Songs disappear after 30 days.

### 2. Adoption
**How do we get users to try a new music experience?**

**3. How do we get users to repetitively return to a new music experience?**
- Create virtuous loops
![virtuous loops](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7230519/52525741-17e59700-2c7c-11e9-9e51-7d6d259ac066.png)




# Notes
## Thoughts
Personality is who you are, traits that grow but also remain consistent over time.
Personalitzaion is trying to predict what you like.


- Other people contributing is exciting because you know they're looking and their is a curiosity/surprise when someone shares with you.
- How do we help people create/curate their music personality?
- Sense of self
- helping people express themselves through music



Listeners want a music service that enables them to easily collect and discover good music.
