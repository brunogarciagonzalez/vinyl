### Features

- Songs disappear after 30 days.

### 2. Adoption
**How do we get users to try a new music experience?**

**3. How do we get users to repetitively return to a new music experience?**
- Create virtuous loops

# Notes
## Thoughts
Personality is who you are, traits that grow but also remain consistent over time.
Personalitzaion is trying to predict what you like.


- Other people contributing is exciting because you know they're looking and their is a curiosity/surprise when someone shares with you.
- How do we help people create/curate their music personality?
- Sense of self
- helping people express themselves through music



Listeners want a music service that enables them to easily collect and discover good music.
