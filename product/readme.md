## Vision
Create your music personality.

Personality is who you are, traits that grow but also remain consistent over time.
Personalitzaion is trying to predict what you like.

## Hypothesis
Listeners want to be able to develop a music identity online by curating their favorite music and sharing it with others.

- Other people contributing is exciting because you know they're looking and their is a curiosity/surprise when someone shares with you.
- How do we help people create/curate their music personality?
- Sense of self
- helping people express themselves through music

How do you encourage interaction and make sure things don't get stale?
- Song limit (25 songs?)
- Songs disappear after 30 days.

Listeners want a music service that enables them to easily collect and discover good music.
